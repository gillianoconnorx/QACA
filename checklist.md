## Code Review Checklist 

 **Code Review Checklist** helps the code reviewers and software developers 
 (during self code review) to gain expertise in the code review process, 
 as these points are easy to remember and follow during the code review process.
 
 
 ## My Code Review Checklist 
 * Commits to git are identifiable
 * Remove Duplicate code
	* obvious logicial errors removed from code 
 * Easily understandable code 
    * is my code formatting correct?
 * No errors due to using testing methods
 * No spelling or grammar errors 
 * All documentation is linked correctly 
 * Checking all requirements are implemented

 ## Pull Requests
 * I began merging my branches into my develop branch; this is to stop confusion and keep master branch clean and organised
 * My plan is to merge my files one by one to the develop branch
 * As I began this process I ran into merge conflicts that were fixed via the command line
 * I ran into an error by accidently merging into the master branch which needed to be reverted
 * Pull requests and merges keep code organised and stop duplicates
