# Metric

## Test Coverage Metric

**Test coverage** is defined as a metric in Software Testing 
that measures the amount of testing performed by a set of test.

 For the development of this assignment I will be using the test coverage metric 
 provided with Visual Studio Code.
 It is a light weight extension that allows users ti run and debug Junit or TestNG test
 cases in Visual Studio Code.
