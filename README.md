# Scrum

## Sprint Backlog

The *sprint backlog* is a list of tasks identified by the Scrum team, or in the case of this assignment myself,  to be completed during the Scrum sprint. During the sprint planning meeting, the number of product backlog items are selected and the tasks necessary to complete each item is identified. 
Estimates of how many hours each task will take will be given.


## Task Estimation
*Test Estimation* is a management activity which approximates how long a Task would take to complete.

To use benefit from task estimation I will begin by 
1. Breaking the project down into tasks
2. Estimate the effort required to complete each task



| Task    	| Estimates    | 
|----------	|--------	|
| Create a new survey     	| 1   	|
| Add a question to the survey   	| 1   	|
| Get a list of all surveys     	| 3   	|
|Get a specific survey by name       	| 3  	|
| Create a new survey response       	| 1  	|
| Add a question to survey response      	| 1   	| 
| Get all survey responses with specific survey     	| 5 |
| Get the average     	| 3    	|
| Get the standard deviation     	| 3  	| 
| Get the max score     	| 3 	| 
| Get the min score     	| 3 	| 
| Get standard deviation for specific question    	| 5  	| 
| Get average for specific question    	| 5   	| 
| Get max for specific question    	| 5     	|
| Get the min for specific questionc    	| 5   	|


## Task Estimates
I have estimated my tasks with story points 
**Story points** rate the relative effort of work in a Fibonacci-like format: 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100
For my task estimation I used, 1,3,5, this will make it easier for me to identify a easy, medium or small task.

## Task Comparsion
To demonstrate how I decided the story points for each task I will explain via task comparsion.

1. Add a question to the survey
2. Get the average for a specific question on a survey

I rated *Add a question to the survey* as a story point 1; as it has a ligher work load

* It will require a test
* It will involve creating new objects

I rated *Get the average for a specific question on a survey* as a story point 5; as it involves more work

* It will require a test
* It will have a method that returns a value
* It will involve the use of sums
* It will involve going through a collection
* It will involve using information from another collection

## Velocity Metric 
*Velocity* is the average amount of work a scrum team completes during a sprint, it can be measured in story points or hours, and is very useful for forecasting.


**Caculating Velocity** to calculate the velocity I add up all the story points and divide them by the number of sprints

*Example* 
The actual velocity is 47, for example if there is 3 sprints it would result in 47/3 
Resulting in the velocity for each sprint would be 16

This would mean the story points would be divied into sections which total 16, for each sprint
 
This can be carried through out the project to stay on track and to manage a suitable work load.
