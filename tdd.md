Testing
Test Driven Development
This application will be coded using Test-driven development (TDD) this is a development technique where you must first write a test that fails before you write new functional code.

I will use the **traffic light** sequence when developing code:

Red
Green
Refactor

1. Red This is writing tests that you know will fail. A red flag will be given by the unit testing framework.

2. Green This is writing code only to make the test pass. It is a concept of coding just enough to make the test pass.

3. Refactor This is when you take your code further than just allowing it to pass. Adding other aspects of code. Whether it means code quality or reusability. If functionality is added the tests will excute again to confirm functionality.
